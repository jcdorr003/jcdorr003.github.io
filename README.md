Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap 4.0

One of my biggest struggles was working a lot on one section of the website and then having the feeling that I needed
to start over from scratch. I did this so many times which ended up causing me to take longer than needed. I still have a lot to work out, but I have most of the site finished besides pulling data from the google sheets. I learned a lot about using Bootstrap while building my website. I will be working on my portfolio to add the rest of the requirements as well as updating as I learn more.  

I started out trying to make a landing page with a carousel but I could not seem to get that to work at all after trying for a long time. I then made a jumbotron from bootstrap for my heading. The about page I have set up to add an image of myself in the left column and a summary about me on the right. In the projects section I have created a grid of 4 projects to include and this is where I need to pull data from google sheets to.  Finally I have my contact form which still needs some styling but has all the fields needed.
